collaboration_example
=====================

This repository is designed as an example for online collaboration by Computer Science students. 
What follows is an example of an introduction that could be used for the use of Github in a course.



Welcome students!

I know that many of you have never used a tool such as Git to collaborate with other programmers. Git is what is known as a
distributed version control system. It allows programmers to keep track of revision history ("save"), collaborate with
others, and create new projects as modifications of others. We will be using it as a collaboration tool. GitHub allows us
to easily create a collaborative environment using the Git system.

As we go forward, we will be using this tool whenever we need to work as a group on a particular project. Stay tuned
for more information on its use!
